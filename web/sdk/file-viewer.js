/**
 * File-viewer manifest — static metadata describing which files a viewer can
 * handle. Define this as a static MANIFEST property on your viewer class.
 *
 * `mimeTypes`, `extensions` and `matchAll` are the *declarative* match: the
 * registry reads them without importing or instantiating anything, so resolving
 * a viewer for a file never pulls a heavy module off the wire.
 * @typedef {object} FileViewerManifest
 * @property {string} id - Unique viewer identifier (kebab-case, e.g. 'pdf')
 * @property {string} name - Human-readable display name (shown in the extensions catalog)
 * @property {string} version - Semantic version (e.g. '1.0.0')
 * @property {string} description - Help text shown in the extensions catalog
 * @property {string[]} [mimeTypes] - Mime types this viewer claims, matched case-insensitively
 * @property {string[]} [extensions] - File extensions this viewer claims, without the leading dot
 * @property {boolean} [matchAll] - Candidate for every file regardless of mime/extension. Reserved for a genuine fallback (the text viewer); defaults to false.
 * @property {number} [priority] - Higher wins when several viewers claim the same file. Defaults to 0, which is the fallback tier.
 * @property {number} [maxBytes] - Decline files larger than this. Defaults to unbounded.

 * @property {string} path - Project-relative path
 * @property {string} mime - Server-reported mime type ('' when unknown)
 * @property {number} size - Bytes on disk
 * @property {boolean} isBinary - Server's byte-sniff observation (advisory, NOT a verdict)

 * @typedef {object} ExtractResult
 * @property {string} [text] - Body text to place in the tool result
 * @property {import('../js/services/ops-api.js').AssetRef[]} [attachments] - Stored assets to attach (image pixels for a multimodal model)

 * @property {boolean} [truncated] - Set when `text` stops short of the whole file

/**

// FileViewer Base Class
// ============================================================================

/**
 * FileViewer — base class for Juggler "file viewer" plugins.
 *
 * A file viewer answers two questions about one file: **how does it look** and
 * **what does the model see**. It is the seam that replaces per-format special
 * cases scattered across the ops layer, the context items, and the renderers.
 *
 * ## Creating a viewer
 *
 * Viewers ship inside an **extension** (a directory with a
 * `juggler.extension.json` manifest). Add a file named `*-file-viewer.js` under
 * the extension's `viewers/` directory — the manifest's `provides.fileViewers`
 * glob registers it automatically.
 *
 * ```javascript
 * import FileViewer from 'juggler/file-viewer';
 *
 * export default class PdfFileViewer extends FileViewer {
 *   static MANIFEST = {
 *     id: 'pdf',
 *     name: 'PDF',
 *     version: '1.0.0',
 *     description: 'Renders PDF documents',
 *     mimeTypes: ['application/pdf'],
 *     extensions: ['pdf'],
 *     priority: 50,
 *   };
 *
 *   async render(source, host) {
 *     const { getDocument } = await import('/js/vendor/pdf.min.mjs');
 *     const doc = await getDocument(source.url()).promise;
 *     // …draw pages into `host`…
 *     return () => doc.destroy();
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Resolution
 *
 * The registry picks a viewer from static MANIFEST data alone — a viewer module
 * is imported only once it has *won*. Candidates are the viewers whose
 * `mimeTypes` or `extensions` match (or that set `matchAll`) and whose
 * `maxBytes` the file does not exceed; {@link FileViewer.claims} can then veto
 * or force-include. The highest `priority` wins, ties broken by extension load
 * order. When nothing claims the file, the host renders a "no viewer" fallback.
 *
 * ## Execution contexts
 *
 * Viewer code is loaded in **two** browser instances, and this class's two
 * methods split cleanly across them:
 *
 * | Method      | Context | Notes                                        |
 * |-------------|---------|----------------------------------------------|
 * | `render()`  | viewer  | Has DOM. Return a teardown function.          |
 * | `extract()` | engine  | No DOM — don't use `document.*` here          |
 *
 * `METHOD_CONTEXT` declares this, and in dev mode
 * (`window.__jugglerDevMode`) a method called in the wrong instance throws.
 *
 * A viewer with a heavy dependency must `import()` it **inside** the method
 * that needs it, so the engine worker never downloads a rendering library it
 * will not use.
 * @class
 * @abstract
