/**
 * Capability manifest validation.
 *
 * Every plugin capability — context item, strategy, command, pinboard item,
 * info card, file viewer — declares itself with a `static MANIFEST`. This is the
 * one check that manifest passes, wherever it is reached from: the SDK base
 * classes call it from their constructors, and `BaseRegistry.validateClass`
 * calls it when a class is loaded or registered.
 *
 * It lives in one place because the two callers see different classes. The
 * registry sees everything a viewer loads from disk; the constructors also see
 * classes that reach the app another way — a strategy the app falls back to
 * without registering, a class a test builds by hand. A rule written twice is a
 * rule that holds in one of those places and not the other.
 *
 * Errors name the **class**, because that is what identifies the plugin at
 * fault. Which of six loaders was running when it was noticed is not something
 * the author can act on.
 * @module sdk/lib/manifest
