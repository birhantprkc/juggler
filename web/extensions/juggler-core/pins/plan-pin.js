/**
 * PlanPin — the current plan, kept where it can be followed.
 *
 * The plan draws no standing card in the transcript: its tool-action rows show
 * each change as it happens, and a second transaction-less tile beside them was
 * only ever a duplicate. This pin is therefore the only place the plan stands
 * still, which is what makes getting its source right matter.
 *
 * A plan belongs to the thread that submitted it, and a sub-thread's plan is its
 * own. So the pin shows the plan of the thread being read, and failing that the
 * nearest ancestor with one — saying whose it is whenever it is not the reader's
 * own. It never merges several threads' plans into one list: no thread is making
 * that claim, so neither should the board.
 *
 * Read-only. The plan changes through the approval-gated `plan` tool, which is
 * where a step's status means something; a checkbox here would be a second,
 * quieter way to change a plan the user approved.
 * @class
 * @augments PinboardItemType
