/**
 * Read a path as it stands. Always resolves to a usable {@link LiveFileResult} —
 * a failure collapses to `exists: false` rather than throwing, because every
 * caller here has somewhere to show "not found" and nowhere to show a stack.
 *
 * The read is user-initiated by construction: someone named this path, in a
 * picker or an `@`-mention or by pinning it. That is what `userInitiated` says to
 * the read/tree ops, and it is what lets the path resolve WITHOUT the
 * working-directory containment check — for a relative `../…` as much as for an
 * absolute one. Without it a path outside the project root fails as "path is
 * outside working directory", which the panel would render as a misleading
 * "File not found".
 *
 * Only the read op takes a signal; `stat` and `getTree` do not, so a caller that
 * can be torn down mid-read must check its own signal before using what comes
 * back rather than assuming this rejected.
 * @param {string} path - File or directory path. A trailing "/" means directory.
 * @param {{signal?: AbortSignal, noIgnore?: boolean, head?: number, whole?: boolean}} [options] - Abort
 *   signal for the file read, whether a directory listing ignores .gitignore, a line
 *   ceiling for a caller showing a preview rather than the whole file, and `whole` for
 *   a caller that wants every line. With neither the read op's own default cap
 *   applies, which is generous but is still a cap.
 * @returns {Promise<LiveFileResult>} What disk said; `exists: false` on any failure.
