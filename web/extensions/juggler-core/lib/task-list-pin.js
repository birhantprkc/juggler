/**
 * The body shared by the Plan and Todo pins: find the nearest list, say whose it
 * is, render it, and offer the way back to it.
 *
 * The two pins differ only in which context item they read, where the list sits
 * inside it, how it renders, and what it says when there isn't one. Everything
 * else — the resolution order, the source line, re-reading on a change, the
 * reveal action — is one behaviour, and it lives here so the two cannot drift.
 *
 * Both are read-only. Ticking a box would have to go through the same
 * approval-gated tool path the assistant uses, whose semantics are wholesale
 * list replacement; until that is designed, a pin shows the list and does not
 * pretend to own it.
