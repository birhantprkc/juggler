/**
 * Tests for the shipped sub-agents, `Explore` and `Research`.
 *
 * A sub-agent is a delegating context item that owns a hidden strategy: the tool
 * call runs as a child thread under a tool filter, approval policy and brief the
 * item defines, and only the child's answer comes back.
 *
 * The load-bearing test here is the **no-hang invariant**. A sub-agent thread has
 * no human in it, and `APPROVAL_POLICY` has no DENY — so a tool the strategy
 * exposes but cannot auto-approve does not prompt anybody, it strands the
 * caller's tool_use forever. Every tool that survives `filterTools` must
 * therefore be either auto-approved by `getApprovalPolicy` or refused by
 * `onToolPending`. That is asserted below against the real core tool list.
 *
 * Both shipped sub-agents are descriptors over `SubagentContextItem`, so the
 * cases below run against each in turn: a third sub-agent should pass them by
 * existing, and any that starts failing marks behaviour that has drifted out of
 * the shared base.
 * @module _tests/subagents-test
