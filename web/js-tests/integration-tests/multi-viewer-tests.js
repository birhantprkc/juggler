/**
 * Integration Tests: Multiple viewers on ONE conversation.
 *
 * The iframe pool puts N viewer WebSockets + 1 engine in flight, but each lane
 * owns its OWN conversation — so two *viewer* clients are never attached to the
 * SAME conversation at once. That's the production multi-tab case (one
 * conversation open in two tabs, each its own WS), and it's exactly the
 * broadcast-to-all-clients path the ack-correlation and context-request races
 * lived on. This suite closes that coverage gap.
 *
 * `open-second-viewer` opens a real second WebSocket (distinct server clientId)
 * subscribed to the active conversation; `assert-second-viewer-converges` waits
 * for that independent client's Yjs doc to match viewer-1's live state. See
 * web/js-tests/utilities/second-viewer.js.
 * @module integration-tests/multi-viewer-tests
 */

/**
 * A second viewer on one conversation receives the full initial state, then
 * live broadcasts for a new turn, then an undo — converging with viewer-1 at
 * each step. Exercises real per-worker fan-out to multiple viewer clients.
