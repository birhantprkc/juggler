/**
 * Rule 4 outranks the follow scroll: a column with a pinned row does not chase
 * the end of its own conversation.
 *
 * The sub-thread tile is where this bit, and the asymmetry is the tell. A row
 * the reader pins part-way up a conversation is safe, because pinning it means
 * they scrolled to it, and rule 11 then withholds every automatic move. A tile
 * is pinned from the END — selecting one is a request to read the child column,
 * so rule A exempts it from re-arming (conversation-area-selection.js) and the
 * view is still sitting at the bottom. The near-bottom gate on rule 8 therefore
 * passes on every item the parent turn appends, and the follow scroll walks the
 * pinned tile up and off the top of the viewport.
 *
 * That is a pin the app itself destroys. The offscreen watcher (rule C) reads
 * "offscreen for three seconds" as "the user has moved on" and demotes the pin
 * — its docstring justifying that by claiming nothing but the user can push the
 * element out. So the tile lost its pin without the reader touching anything,
 * and from then on every arriving item auto-selected, which in a column chain
 * closes the sub-thread column being read (ColumnSelectionState.selectItem
 * truncates). The reader sees each new item steal their selection.
 *
 * Both halves are asserted, because fixing only the symptom leaves the cause:
 * the view must not carry a pinned row away, and the selection must survive the
 * demotion window that used to follow.
