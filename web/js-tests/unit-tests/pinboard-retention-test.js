/**
 * Pins that survive a tab switch.
 *
 * Every pin used to be torn down the moment the user looked at another tab and
 * built again on the way back, which is right for a pin that re-reads a file —
 * it cannot then show anything stale — and fatal for one hosting something that
 * cannot be rebuilt: a live connection, an audio session, an `<iframe>` whose
 * page would reload and start over. A type may now ask for `retain` in its
 * manifest and be hidden instead.
 *
 * What is asserted here is the difference between the two, and the boundary
 * around the exemption: retention spares a pin the tab switch and nothing else.
 * A config change, leaving the board, the board losing its conversation, the
 * element leaving the document, throwing — each of those still ends it, and each
 * is a way a retained pin could otherwise be leaked, still running, with nothing
 * on screen to reach it by. The identity assertion is the load-bearing one:
 * these tests check the *same* DOM node comes back, not an equal-looking one,
 * because an `<iframe>` that was rebuilt looks identical and has lost everything.
 *
 * Driven through probe item types registered only here, as
 * `unit:pinboard-file-edits` does: a pin shipped in product code purely to be
 * measured would be a promise the app cannot keep.
 * @module unit-tests/pinboard-retention-test
