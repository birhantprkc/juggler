/**
 * Concurrent-init tests for BaseRegistry.
 *
 * `init()` marks itself initialized only once its whole load pass has finished,
 * so callers arriving while one is running see a cold registry and start their
 * own. Read-only sub-agents run in parallel and each turn's tool list calls
 * `contextItemRegistry.init()`, so four threads dispatching together produced
 * four full import passes — each with its own HTTP fetches — on the single
 * engine thread they share.
 * @module unit-tests/registry-init-race-test
