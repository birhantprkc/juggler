/**
 * The harness's own budget contract.
 *
 * Every wait in a test is supposed to ride the deadline the run will actually
 * fail on, rather than a nominal sub-timeout chosen when a lane had the pool to
 * itself. That rule was written once for mock-LLM tests and quietly missed the
 * unit suites entirely — for months every "rides the budget" wait in a unit
 * suite fell back to its bare 3s or 5s, and the suite paid for it in browser
 * tests lost to load, one different one per run.
 *
 * Nothing detected that, because a budget is invisible until the machine is
 * busy. These cases are the detector: they assert the deadline exists and that
 * the waits which claim to ride it actually do.
 * @module unit-tests/test-budget-test
