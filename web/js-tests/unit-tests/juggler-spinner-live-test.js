/**
 * Tests for the busy spinner's `live` mode: the cascade as a readout of the
 * work behind it rather than a fixed decoration.
 *
 * The invariant that matters most here is the opt-in. Most spinners in the app
 * sit in front of a plain fetch and have no concurrency or throughput to
 * report; they must keep behaving exactly as they always have, so a spinner
 * without the `live` attribute has to ignore every setter outright.
 *
 * Also covers `runningToolsInTree`, the doc-side source of both spinner inputs:
 * it surveys only tools actually executing, so queued or approval-parked work
 * can't be passed off as concurrency, and it dates the wait from the tool still
 * running rather than from the start of the turn.
