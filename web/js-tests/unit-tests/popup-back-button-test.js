/**
 * Unit tests for popup-manager's Back-button / unified-dismissal wiring.
 *
 * Covers:
 *  - an EMBEDDED context (an iframe, which every test lane is) pushes no
 *    sentinel and reads no popstate as a Back press — the session history is
 *    joint with the embedder and its siblings, so both would be theirs;
 *  - opening an overlay pushes ONE sentinel history entry carrying the marker;
 *  - a second, stacked overlay shares that single entry (one Back press clears
 *    the whole layer);
 *  - closing programmatically drops the sentinel via history.back(), but only
 *    once the LAST overlay is gone;
 *  - a `popstate` (the Back press) dismisses open overlays without a redundant
 *    history.back();
 *  - the `popstate` answering our OWN sentinel drop is not a Back press: an
 *    overlay opened while it was in flight survives it, and the history layer is
 *    covered again afterwards — judged by where that pop says it landed, not by
 *    what the page's current entry happens to hold;
 *  - a retraction nothing will ever answer doesn't spend a later Back press;
 *  - Escape routes through the same registered-handler dismissal;
 *  - closeAllPopups() closes most-recently-opened first (LIFO), and also
 *    dismisses dropdowns wired through the POPUP_CLOSE_ALL event.
 *
 * The History API is stubbed for all but the first case, so the test never
 * navigates for real and we assert only that popup-manager drives push/back
 * correctly. Nothing here may traverse the real one: a lane is an iframe, and
 * its session history is JOINT with the pool page and every sibling lane, so a
 * back() from here pops whatever is on top of that shared stack — routinely a
 * sibling lane loading its next test page, which is sent back a document while
 * this frame is delivered no popstate at all. The stub answers each back() with
 * a popstate of its own, as the real API does; how long it takes to answer is
 * itself under test, so each case says which it wants.
