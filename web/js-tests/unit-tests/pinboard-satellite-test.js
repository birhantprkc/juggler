/**
 * Detached pinboard tests — a board in a window of its own, on the one
 * conversation it was opened for.
 *
 * The two halves of that are what most of these cases are about: what the board
 * shows comes from its own URL and its own session, so nothing outside it can
 * move it and its owner going away costs it nothing; and the one thing it does
 * send back — a reveal — carries that conversation, because the window it is
 * going to has very likely moved on.
 *
 * The mode is normally decided by the URL the document was loaded with, which a
 * test lane cannot choose, so `__setViewModeForTests` supplies the query string
 * instead. Every case restores it, because a lane that stayed in pinboard mode
 * would quietly reshape every suite that ran after it.
 *
 * The CSS half cannot be asserted in the lane either — `data-view` is on the
 * lane's own `<html>` and setting it there would restyle the harness — so the
 * layout rules are measured in a child iframe wearing the same stylesheets, the
 * way the shell suite measures the phone breakpoint.
 * @module unit-tests/pinboard-satellite-test
