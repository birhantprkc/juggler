/**
 * The composer's send re-entrancy latch.
 *
 * sendMessage() reads the box, then awaits the thread's skill snapshot and any
 * `@`-mention/dropped-file reads before it dispatches `send-message`. The box is
 * only cleared downstream (by Conversation.sendMessage, in response to that
 * event), so for the width of those awaits the text is still in the textarea,
 * `is-empty` is still off, and the button and Enter are both live. Over a slow
 * link that window is seconds wide — long enough for a user who thinks the
 * button did nothing to press it again — and every press that gets through
 * becomes its own user message: the worker appends the first and queues the
 * rest in pendingItems, with no de-duplication anywhere on the path.
 *
 * These tests hold the skill snapshot open to stand in for that slow link, and
 * pin the three properties the latch has to have:
 *
 *   1. A second send during the window is refused, and exactly ONE send-message
 *      is dispatched.
 *   2. The latch is released once the send dispatches, so the next send works.
 *   3. The latch is released even when a lookup REJECTS — sendMessage() is
 *      called un-awaited from the click and keydown handlers, so a throw
 *      surfaces nowhere and a stuck latch would brick the box permanently.
 * @module unit-tests/composer-send-latch-test
