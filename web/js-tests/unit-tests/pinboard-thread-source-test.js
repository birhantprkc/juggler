/**
 * Where a pinned Plan comes from: the thread the reader is actually in, and the
 * nearest ancestor that owns one.
 *
 * Two halves, because the answer is assembled from two places. The tab decides
 * which thread is being read — and selecting an item inside a sub-thread opens a
 * properties panel to its right and makes that panel the active column, which is
 * why the scan runs LEFTWARDS. `getActiveConversationColumn` falls back to the
 * FIRST conversation-area, which is the root; both are asserted side by side here
 * so the difference between the two questions is written down rather than implied.
 *
 * The pinboard decides what that thread can see. A plan made inside a sub-thread
 * belongs to that sub-thread, so a child with no plan of its own inherits the one
 * its parent holds and stops there — the conversation root is the end of the walk,
 * not the answer to it. The fixture gives the root a different plan precisely so a
 * lookup that shortcuts to the root would report the wrong title.
 *
 * The board is driven through a **probe item type** registered only here. A pin
 * provider shipped in product code just to be measured would be a promise the app
 * cannot keep, so the probe stashes the PinContext it is handed and the test calls
 * the services on it directly.
 * @module unit-tests/pinboard-thread-source-test
