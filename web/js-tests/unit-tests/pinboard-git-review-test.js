/**
 * What a pin gets when it asks for a review: `services.git.review()` and
 * `services.git.diff()`, end to end from the pin's hand to the HTTP request.
 *
 * The ambient card and the explicit review are two different questions asked of
 * the same repository, and this suite exists to keep them apart. The card is
 * polled, bounded and best-effort; a review is asked for, says what it could not
 * reach, and is never smoothed over into a claim the server did not make. So the
 * cases that matter are the ones where an answer must be refused rather than
 * shown: a caller that cancelled, a pin that has gone away, a project that
 * changed while the answer was in flight.
 *
 * Driven through a probe item type registered only here, the same way
 * `unit:pinboard-tasks` does, because the thing under test is the context a pin
 * is handed and not any of the pieces behind it.
 * @module unit-tests/pinboard-git-review-test
