/**
 * What happens to a message the worker refused.
 *
 * A send clears the box before the worker has accepted anything, so the only
 * copy of what the user wrote is the pending message the conversation holds.
 * Two things can happen to it: the client re-broadcasts its model config and
 * resends it once (Guard A's self-heal), or it goes back into the box for the
 * user to act on. Both must carry the WHOLE message — a message is its text and
 * its image attachments together — because nothing else holds the images by
 * then: the box was cleared, no item was written (the worker bounces a
 * `no-model` send before it appends anything), and the asset bytes stay alive
 * only while something references them, a persisted draft included.
 *
 * These drive the three methods that own it against stubs, the way
 * message-history-test drives Session.addMessageToHistory: the surface each one
 * touches is two or three fields, and the world a real Conversation needs is
 * irrelevant to every assertion here.
 * @module unit-tests/pending-message-restore-test
