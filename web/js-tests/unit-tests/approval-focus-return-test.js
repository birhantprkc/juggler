/**
 * Answering an inline approval must hand the keyboard back to the message box.
 *
 * An action-confirmation holds focus on one of its own buttons while it is up,
 * then removes itself when answered — which drops focus to <body>. No other
 * focus rule fires at the end of a turn to reclaim it, so without the explicit
 * hand-back the user has to click the box before they can type again. The
 * widget signals with a bubbling `restore-input-focus` and conversation-tab
 * decides where focus lands (Rule 20). Regression guard for that.
 *
 * Covers both halves of the rule: that focus comes back at all, and that it is
 * reclaimed when the answer's re-render bounces it to <body> a beat later — a
 * hand-back that fires once has already spent itself by then.
 * @module unit-tests/approval-focus-return-test
