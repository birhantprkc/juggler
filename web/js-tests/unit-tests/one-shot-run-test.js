/**
 * One-shot run tests.
 *
 * `runOneShot` is the whole of an unattended run: a process is blocked on the
 * single result it sends, and nothing downstream can tell a run that answered
 * badly from one that answered well. So what is guarded here is what that
 * result must be able to distinguish — finished, parked on a tool that wants a
 * human, errored, and never delivered — plus the two silent-wrong failures the
 * run is built to avoid: a conversation left un-configured (which parks on its
 * first tool), and a turn fence that reads the idle from *before* the send and
 * reports an empty run as a success.
