/**
 * The scroll-to-top control reaches the top.
 *
 * Where the control aims is the fragile part, because the reversed scroller's
 * scrollTop sign is engine detail. A delta measured from the content column's
 * first CHILD read as a few dozen pixels of chrome on any root conversation,
 * because the column leads with a `display: none` `thread-column-actions` and a
 * box-less element's rect is all zeros: the button moved the view a fraction of
 * an inch and stopped.
 *
 * So the assertion is the whole journey — press it from the end of a long
 * conversation and the oldest message must be on screen — not the shape of the
 * aim, which is free to be computed however it likes.
 *
 * The journey is taken instantly. The control glides, and a lane's engine WebView
 * is hidden and software-rendered, so the rendering updates that drive a smooth
 * scroll can be throttled to nothing — waiting on a glide there waits on a scroll
 * that has not begun, which reads exactly like one that never happened.
 *
 * The same throttling is what the last section is about. A column also owes one
 * scroll to the position its conversation was left at, a frame after it renders,
 * and that frame arrives whenever the engine gets round to it — so the restore is
 * held to the same rule as everything else here: landing it on a reader who has
 * since scrolled is an automatic move away from their place.
