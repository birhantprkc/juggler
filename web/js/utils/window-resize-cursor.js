/**
 * Edge-resize cursor marker for the frameless desktop window: records on
 * `<html>`, as `data-resize-cursor`, that the pointer is over a window-resize
 * edge, so the CSS in styles.css can let that cursor through.
 *
 * A frameless window has no native resize border, so the runtime hit-tests the
 * pointer itself and reports a hit by writing the cursor to
 * `document.body.style.cursor`. That alone is invisible: `cursor` is inherited,
 * so any element with a cursor of its own — every button's `pointer`, the
 * composer's `text`, the header's `default`, 170-odd declarations in all —
 * overrides it, and the edges that matter are all covered by one. The window
 * could be resized, but nothing said so, which reads as no resize edge at all.
 *
 * So this marks the state and styles.css spends one `!important` on it. The
 * marker is a gate, not data: the cursor itself still comes from `body`, which
 * is why the rule can be a single `inherit` rather than a mapping of the eight
 * edge cursors.
 *
 * Why read the runtime's verdict instead of hit-testing the pointer here: the
 * band's size is the runtime's to know (the app sizes it through the
 * `system.resizeHandle*` flags — see resizeHandleFlags in
 * cmd/juggler-app/app_state.go), and a second copy of the geometry would be a
 * second thing to keep in step, wrong in exactly the places that are hardest to
 * notice. The runtime's listener is registered in the capture phase, so by the
 * time this one runs for the same event the verdict is already written.
 *
 * Inert in a browser tab: there is no window to resize and nothing writes the
 * body cursor, so the marker never appears.
 * @module utils/window-resize-cursor
