/**
 * Viewer fault reporting.
 *
 * The viewer runs in a window whose console cannot be opened in a release
 * build, so a fault that reaches nothing but `console.error` reaches nobody. The
 * engine already routes its own faults to the app log from inside its worker
 * (engine-worker-runtime.js); this is the viewer's half of that, and the sink
 * every guarded callback reports through.
 *
 * It matters most on the Yjs fan-out. Every observer, and so every component
 * re-render, runs synchronously inside Y.applyUpdate, so one component throwing
 * mid-render aborts the whole transaction: the observers after it never run, and
 * without a report the only evidence is a conversation that quietly stops
 * updating.
 * @module utils/fault-report

 * have nothing to do with it. Contained, the failure costs one component's
