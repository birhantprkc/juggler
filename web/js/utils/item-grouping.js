/**
 * item-grouping — folds a run of adjacent tool-use rows into one display entry.
 *
 * This is a **display transform only**. Nothing here reads or writes the
 * conversation document: `buildDisplayItems` takes the items a column is about
 * to render and returns the same Y.Maps with each run replaced by an
 * {@link ItemGroup} wrapper. Turning the preference off renders the identical
 * list unfolded, because the model never changed.
 *
 * ## What counts as groupable — inferred, with one declared exception
 *
 * A tool use is exactly an item whose Yjs `type` is `'tool-action'` (see
 * `model/SCHEMA.md` §2). Every item that must NOT fold already has a different
 * type: `user`, `assistant`, `thinking`, `error`, `thread`, and standing
 * context items (whose `type` IS their context-item id — `system-prompt`,
 * `memory`, `file-content`, …). So for almost everything groupability needs no
 * declaration at all: a new tool groups automatically, and a new
 * standing-context type never does.
 *
 * What the type cannot express is a tool row that is not merely the record of a
 * tool having run. An item that opts out of a standing card (`isVisible()`
 * false — the plan and the todo list) renders its entire state on its tool row,
 * so folding that row hides the item ITSELF, not a record of it; and a row the
 * user must keep in sight (a question they answered, a slash command or a
 * conversation created outside this transcript) is not summary fodder either.
 * Such a type declares `static isGroupable()` false on its `ContextItem` class
 * — the one thing an author opts into — and its rows are left unfolded, each
 * breaking the run around it like any other real row.
 *
 * The one refinement is invisibility. A tool-action whose result is a context
 * item renders no row at all (`conversation-area-rendering.createToolActionElement`),
 * as does an assistant/thinking bubble with no visible text. Such items are
 * treated as transparent — they neither join a run nor split one — so a fold
 * matches what the user actually sees on screen.
 * @module utils/item-grouping
