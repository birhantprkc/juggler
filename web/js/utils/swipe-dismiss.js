/**
 * Push an overlay off the screen with a finger. Shared by every surface a phone
 * puts over the page: the conversation drawer swipes left, the pinboard panel
 * swipes right, a bottom sheet is dragged down by its grabber. They differ in
 * which way they leave and what else is competing for the gesture, and in
 * nothing else — so they go away the same way, and there is one place to fix it
 * when a browser disagrees about who owns a touch.
 *
 * The surface tracks the finger 1:1 and, released past the threshold, dismisses;
 * anything short snaps back. The transform is inline only while the finger is
 * down — dropping it hands the surface back to its CSS transition, which glides
 * it home or the rest of the way out once the caller's `onDismiss` takes the
 * open class off.
 *
 * A mouse never swipes a whole surface. Each of them has a scrim, an Escape and
 * a button, and inside them a mouse drag already means something else (selecting
 * text, reordering a tab) — so a surface-wide gesture is touch and pen only. A
 * dedicated handle has no such ambiguity and takes a mouse too (`allowMouse`).
 *
 * Two rules decide whether the gesture is ours, and both matter on a surface
 * with scrolling content:
 *
 *   The first decisive movement claims an axis and keeps it. A drag down the
 *   drawer is the tab list scrolling, and once released the pointer is dropped
 *   for good rather than reconsidered as the finger travels.
 *
 *   On a surface that asks for it, a drag starting over something which can
 *   still scroll the way the finger is going belongs to that scroller. The
 *   pinboard's content is a two-axis scroll box whose commonest occupant is a
 *   code block wider than a phone: a rightward drag there is the reader
 *   scrolling back to the left margin, right up until the margin is reached, and
 *   only then the board leaving. That is the same handoff a nested scroller gets
 *   natively, and the panel needs it stated because it cannot declare
 *   `touch-action: pan-y` the way the drawer does — that would forbid horizontal
 *   panning for everything inside it. A surface whose `touch-action` already
 *   forbids panning on the swipe axis leaves it off: there is no native scroll
 *   to defer to, so deferring would only lose the gesture to a scroll box that
 *   was never going to move.
 *
 * `touch-action` alone would not hold the gesture anyway. A real finger drifts
 * across its own axis, and a browser is entitled to read that drift as the start
 * of a scroll — which cancels the pointer and leaves the surface springing back
 * mid-swipe. Cancelling the touchmove once the swipe owns the gesture is what
 * actually holds it, and the listener is registered up front and non-passive
 * because a browser decides whether a touch can be blocked when the finger
 * lands, not once it has moved.
