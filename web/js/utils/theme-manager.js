/**
 * Theme Manager - Handles the light/dark/system theme setting.
 *
 * There are three *modes*:
 *   - 'system' (default): follow the OS light/dark setting, live.
 *   - 'light' / 'dark':   an explicit override that ignores the OS.
 * A mode resolves to a concrete *theme* ('light' or 'dark') for painting.
 *
 * The three modes are what gets stored, but only Settings offers all three by
 * name. The header button is a plain two-state light switch over them: it flips
 * the theme on screen, and a theme is pinned only while it differs from the OS
 * setting — choosing the OS's own theme stores 'system' instead. So the button
 * can never strand anyone in a fixed theme, and 'system' stays reachable
 * without ever being an option someone has to understand. See toggleTheme().
 *
 * Who owns the mode depends on which client is reading it — see ui-pref-scope.js
 * for the rule this shares with the zoom. The sources, best first:
 *
 *   - desktop window: this project's saved session mode (window.__sessionThemeMode,
 *     server-injected and authoritative) > this window's own mode from a prior
 *     load (sessionStorage, survives reload) > a ?mode= seed inherited from the
 *     window that opened this one (carries 'system' faithfully, so 'auto'
 *     survives the hand-off) > a resolved ?theme= seed (concrete colour only, a
 *     fallback) > this device's stored mode > 'system'.
 *   - remote browser: this device's stored mode > the window-scoped hints above >
 *     the session mode > 'system', and nothing is written back. A phone opens in
 *     the theme the desktop is in, but switching it to dark leaves the desktop
 *     alone and doesn't fight whatever a second remote device prefers.
 *
 * The per-window sessionStorage layer sits above the seed so a project switch
 * keeps 'system'/'auto'. Switching projects reloads the page with the same URL,
 * so the baked ?theme= seed (a resolved concrete 'light'/'dark') is still present
 * but stale; without a per-window record it would outrank the window's real
 * 'system' mode and get persisted into the switched-in project, silently pinning
 * it to a fixed theme. sessionStorage is empty in a genuinely fresh window, so
 * the seed still wins there (its intended anti-flash handoff).
