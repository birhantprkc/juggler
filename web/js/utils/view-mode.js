/**
 * View mode — which shell this document is, decided once from its own URL.
 *
 * There are two. `main` is Juggler: the header, the conversation bar, the
 * columns, and the pinboard behind the right edge. `pinboard` is a board that
 * has been detached from one of those windows into its own: the same app, the
 * same session and the same board, with the conversation shell left out.
 *
 * A detached board is a view of one conversation, named in the same URL. It does
 * not follow the window it was detached from and does not end with it: what it
 * shows is decided by its own address, which is what lets one be left open on a
 * conversation while the window that opened it goes elsewhere. The owner in the
 * URL is only where a reveal is sent — the board has no columns of its own, so
 * pointing at a thread is a thing it asks that window to do.
 *
 * The URL is still not worth sharing: it names a viewer on someone's screen as
 * well as a conversation, and hands the reveal to whoever holds that id.
 *
 * The paint-critical half of this is read in index.html's pre-paint block,
 * which sets `data-view` so the reduced layout lands on the first frame. This
 * module is the logic half, and the same split theme and zoom already use.
 * @module utils/view-mode
