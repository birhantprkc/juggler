/**
 * Modal Surface — the single home for a transient, self-contained overlay.
 *
 * A transient modal is one built on demand, appended to `<body>`, and thrown
 * away when it closes: the command editor and manager, the skill previews, the
 * install-scope picker, the image lightbox. Every one of them was hand-rolling
 * the same four steps — create a root, append it, take a `markPopupOpen` token
 * so Escape and the browser/mobile Back button dismiss it, and unwind all three
 * on close — plus a re-entrancy guard, which two of them spelled differently
 * and one omitted entirely.
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT `presentPopup`'s job and does not build on it.
 * `presentPopup` presents a menu anchored to a trigger, under an id that makes
 * one open menu per id: opening a second closes the first. Modals have no
 * trigger to anchor to and must STACK — a confirm dialog over an open bin modal
 * is a live flow — so they take an id-less `markPopupOpen` token instead, which
 * is also what keeps `isForeignPopupOpen` meaningful. See popup-manager.js.
 *
 * The app's PERSISTENT modals (about, bin, context-preview, modal-dialog,
 * settings-panel, update-notice) are custom elements that toggle their own
 * visibility rather than creating and destroying a root, and several carry
 * behaviour this has no place for — modal-dialog's focus restore, update-notice
 * opting out of dismissal for a required notice. They stay as they are.
 * @module utils/modal-surface
