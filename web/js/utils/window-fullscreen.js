/**
 * Fullscreen marker for the native desktop window: records on `<html>` whether
 * the window is fullscreen, as `data-window-fullscreen="1"`.
 *
 * One thing reads it — the macOS traffic-light gutter in styles.css. The header
 * reserves 80px at its left for the lights AppKit draws over the top-left of the
 * webview; fullscreen removes them, so without this the gutter is just a hole to
 * the left of the logo.
 *
 * State arrives two ways, because neither alone covers the window's life:
 *   - The runtime's fullscreen events, for every toggle the user makes. These
 *     are injected by the native side and work even though the outbound
 *     `Window.*` RPC does not (see window-caption-controls.js).
 *   - One read of the window-control endpoint at load, for the window that was
 *     restored straight into fullscreen: it entered before this page existed, so
 *     no event was ever addressed to it.
 *
 * Inert in a browser tab and in the engine worker: neither is a native window,
 * and a tab has no host to ask.
 * @module utils/window-fullscreen
