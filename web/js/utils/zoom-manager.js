/**
 * Zoom Manager - Handles UI zoom via root font-size scaling.
 *
 * Who owns the zoom depends on which client is reading it — see ui-pref-scope.js
 * for the rule this shares with the theme. The sources, best first:
 *
 *   - desktop window: this project's saved session zoom (window.__sessionZoom,
 *     server-injected and authoritative) > an inherited ?zoom= seed from the
 *     window that opened this one > this device's cached value > the default.
 *   - remote browser: this device's cached value > the session zoom > the
 *     default. Nothing is written back to the session, so a phone that zooms out
 *     doesn't resize the desktop window it dialled into.
 *
 * One limitation, in the transport rather than here: a Cloudflare quick tunnel
 * hands out a fresh hostname every session, so a device reaching a project that
 * way gets an empty localStorage each time and opens at the session zoom again.
 *
 * The synchronous pre-paint block in index.html applies the same precedence
 * before first paint (a font-size change reflows everything, so a late
 * correction is a visible jump); this module is the authoritative reconciler and
 * owns persistence.
