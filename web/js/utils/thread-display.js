/**
 * What a thread tile shows: the result of the ONE run that item stands for.
 *
 * A thread called more than once has one parent item per call (see
 * model/thread-alias.js), and each shows a single run's result: its own, frozen
 * when that run settled, so a later call can never rewrite what an earlier tile
 * says — or, for the last of them, whatever the session is doing now.
 * An item with no run selector falls back to the thread's `result`, its current
 * summary: a user-created thread, a fold, and every document written before
 * aliases record completion only there.
 *
 * Until the run has come to rest there is nothing worth showing on the tile.
 * Whatever live work is going on inside (streaming an assistant message,
 * awaiting tool approval) is visible only when the user drills into the
 * sub-thread itself — the tile face just shows a status block.
 * @param {any} threadYMap - The thread item Y.Map (canonical or alias).

 * files costs its caller the answer alone. Both figures are stamped on the
