/**
 * Reassembly for messages the server had to split.
 *
 * A WebSocket message has no size limit on the wire, but every client library
 * imposes one on what it will accept. Node's built-in WebSocket — what the
 * headless engine host runs on — refuses anything over 128 MiB by closing the
 * connection, which nothing recovers from on its own: the client reconnects,
 * the server re-sends the same message, and the conversation stays unusable.
 * So the server splits a message that large into binary frames (see
 * cmd/juggler/server/ws_chunk.go) and this puts it back together.
 *
 * The frame layout is fixed on both sides:
 *
 *   magic   4 bytes   "JGC1"
 *   kind    1 byte    what the reassembled bytes are (WS_CHUNK_KIND_*)
 *   id      8 bytes   uint64 BE, unique per connection
 *   index   4 bytes   uint32 BE
 *   total   4 bytes   uint32 BE
 *   data    remainder
 * @module utils/ws-chunk
