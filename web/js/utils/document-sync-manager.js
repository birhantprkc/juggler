   * a batch runs the entire UI fan-out synchronously inside Y.applyUpdate — the
   * Yjs observers, the conversation:changed dispatch, and every component
   * re-render they reach — and an assistant bubble re-renders by re-parsing its

   * the length of a message that grows to n, so at a fixed window it costs
   * O(n²) over a turn and the stutter gets worse the longer the model talks.
   * Batching on a window proportional to what the last batch actually cost
   * bounds the total at a fixed fraction of wall-clock time instead.
   *
   * Measured cost, rather than message length, because length is a poor proxy
   * for it: tables and fenced code blocks cost several times what the same
   * weight of prose does, and the whole point is to track the real thing. It
   * also calibrates itself to the machine, and it costs nothing off the main
   * thread — the engine worker has no DOM to render into, so its batches stay
   * cheap and its window stays at the floor.
   *
   * Deliberately here and not in the components that do the expensive work:
   * conversation-area measures element heights and the reader's scroll anchor
   * either side of the content update, synchronously, to glide the growing
   * bubble and hold the reader's place. Deferring the render out from between
   * those two measurements breaks both. Coalescing at the source keeps every
   * consumer's timing assumptions intact, and keeps the trailing edge free:
   * pending updates are always applied, only later, which matters because
   * nothing downstream guarantees a final re-render once a turn ends.
