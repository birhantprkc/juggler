/**
 * One unattended run, carried out inside the engine.
 *
 * The server asks for this (`run-one-shot`) and the engine answers it
 * (`one-shot-result`) because the engine is where a conversation can actually be
 * made: the system prompt, the strategy, the permission rules and the auto items
 * are written into the Yjs document by the model, not by the worker, so a
 * conversation created any other way starts with an empty system prompt and the
 * default strategy — and then runs, looks healthy, and answers nothing it was
 * asked. `Session.createConversation` is the one call that seeds all of it, and
 * it is already the call the new-conversation tool makes from here.
 *
 * Exactly one reply is sent, whatever happens, because the process on the other
 * end is blocked on it.
 * @module engine-one-shot
