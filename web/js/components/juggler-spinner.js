/**
 * Juggler busy spinner — clubs orbiting a central point and flipping on their
 * own axis, evoking a juggling cascade. The clubs are the same shapes used in
 * the Juggler logo.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   <juggler-spinner></juggler-spinner>
 *   <juggler-spinner style="--size: 2rem"></juggler-spinner>
 *   <juggler-spinner style="--size: 1rem; --duration: 1.2s; color: white"></juggler-spinner>
 *   <juggler-spinner live></juggler-spinner>
 *
 * CSS knobs (set on the host):
 *   --size      — overall diameter         (default 1.5rem)
 *   --duration  — one orbital cycle        (default 1.5s)
 *   color       — club fill                (inherited from the parent's
 *                                           `color`, so the spinner adapts
 *                                           to the surrounding theme by
 *                                           default)
 *
 * The clubs are drawn with `fill: currentColor`, so changing `color` on the
 * host (or any ancestor) recolours the spinner — no extra knob needed.
 *
 * ## The `live` attribute
 *
 * By default a spinner is a fixed three-club cascade at a fixed rate: it says
 * "something is happening" and nothing more, which is all a fetch-waiter (the
 * model-selector menu, the settings loader, the skills list) has to say.
 *
 * `live` opts a spinner into reporting the work it sits in front of, so the
 * cascade becomes a readout rather than decoration: {@link clubs} tracks how
 * many tool calls are executing in parallel, and {@link report} tracks what the
 * turn is actually doing — waiting, streaming, or parked on a tool call. Only
 * spinners whose owner can supply those numbers should carry it — a spinner
 * that opts in and is never fed simply rests at the default cascade, which is
 * exactly the non-live appearance.
