/**
 * <pinboard-panel> — the board itself, in three bands: a toolbar that names the
 * surface, a strip of tabs, and the active pin. It is the only piece that reads
 * both the shared board and this viewer's view of it, and it routes every edit
 * through the host service rather than the store, so dedupe, reveal and the
 * status line all happen in one place.
 *
 * The panel also resolves the active-context snapshot — the project, the visible
 * conversation, the thread being read — and hands it down. Item types never walk
 * session internals to find that out for themselves.
 *
 * A detached board resolves the same snapshot from the same session, with one
 * substitution: the conversation is the one named in its URL rather than the one
 * this viewer happens to be showing, and the thread is that conversation's root.
 * A board is a window onto one conversation and stays there — which is what makes
 * it worth leaving open on work that takes a while — so nothing it shows depends
 * on the window it was detached from still existing, or still being anywhere near
 * the conversation it was detached from.
