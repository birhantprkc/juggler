/**
 * <info-rail> — the ambient stack of "info cards" parked in the empty sidebar
 * space just above the Bin (Tips, Git status, …). Each card gets the same chrome:
 * an eyebrow label, a × that hides it (bring it back from the info-cards menu the
 * rail heads the stack with), and a content region the card fills itself. The
 * gate-1 enabled card instances are supplied by
 * {@link module:services/info-cards-manager}; the cards themselves are plugins of
 * the `@juggler/core` extension.
 *
 * The rail also hosts the {@link module:components/info-cards-button|"i" menu} as
 * the first child of its stack, so the control rides immediately above the cards
 * it manages, and stays reachable to bring hidden cards back when no card is up.
 *
 * The rail asks for exactly the height its cards need (`flex: 0 0 auto`) and the
 * tab list takes everything above it, so the list runs right down to the topmost
 * card: it scrolls only when the column is genuinely full, never beside space it
 * could have used. What the cards don't get to win is the whole column — CSS caps
 * the rail at a share of it (`max-height`), and that resolved cap, not the rail's
 * own box, is the budget {@link InfoRail#_fitCount} measures against. Reading its
 * own height instead would be circular now that its height is its content: a rail
 * showing one card would measure room for one card and could never take a dropped
 * one back.
 *
 * Two limits, in this order. {@link MAX_CARDS} caps how many cards are ever
 * mounted, so a tall window doesn't hand the sidebar over to them. Then geometry:
 * cards stack top-priority-first and, below the first, are shown *whole or not at
 * all* — any that don't fully fit the budget are dropped from the tail. The first
 * card is the exception; rather than leave a card-sized hole above the Bin it is
 * kept and allowed to run off the rail's top edge, faded, while enough of it stays
 * visible to be worth reading.
 *
 * A single ResizeObserver watches the column (for the budget: sidebar drag, window
 * resize) and every mounted card (for content that grows after it was measured),
 * and reconciles synchronously — the observer runs after layout but before paint,
 * so a shrink never paints a half-clipped card. Surviving cards are reused across
 * reconciles, so tip rotation isn't reset as the sidebar resizes.
 *
 * Nothing polls the rail. A dropped card is torn down, so a periodic re-fit would
 * rebuild — and remount, and refetch — every card that doesn't fit, once per tick.
 *
 * Not an ARIA live region — rotating tip text would spam a screen reader.
