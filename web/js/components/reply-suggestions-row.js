/**
 * Suggested replies: the row of chips directly above the composer.
 *
 * That position is the whole design. It is where a phone keyboard puts its word
 * suggestions, and the chips are cut from the composer's own material — same
 * background, same corner radius, same font as the box the words land in (see
 * the `reply-suggestions` rules in `components.css`, which share their surface
 * declarations with `composer-box-wrapper` so the two cannot drift apart). A
 * chip then reads as the composer offering to fill itself in, rather than as
 * another control the column owns.
 *
 * The row decides nothing: `services/reply-suggestions-controller.js` decides
 * whether to ask at all, and `conversation-area.js` decides which columns get a
 * row and when it clears. This is handed a list and draws it.
 * @module components/reply-suggestions-row
