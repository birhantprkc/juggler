/**
 * Thread aliases.
 *
 * A thread a tool calls more than once gets ONE PARENT ITEM PER CALL. The first
 * call inserts the thread itself — the canonical item, which owns the
 * transcript. Every later call inserts an ALIAS: a thread item carrying no
 * transcript of its own, pointing at the canonical with `aliasOf`, and stamped
 * with a RUN SELECTOR (`runToolUseId`) naming the single run it stands for.
 *
 * Selecting either tile opens the same column — they are two views of one body
 * of content. But each tile carries a single run's result, so five calls into
 * one session read as five results down the parent transcript rather than one
 * tile whose text keeps being overwritten.
 *
 * WHICH run depends on where the item stands, and on whether the model has read
 * it. The LAST item referring to a session is its live view: it shows the run
 * the transcript is on now, whoever started it — including a run a human started
 * by typing into a stopped child, which no call named and which nothing else in
 * the parent stands for. Every earlier item stands for the one call it was made
 * by, frozen where that run settled, so a later result can never rewrite a tile
 * further up. An item whose result has gone to the model (`runResultFed`) is
 * frozen the same way, and a run arriving after that is appended as a RECEIPT: a
 * third kind of item, standing for a run nobody called, naming it by the message
 * that started it (`runItemId`) since there is no call to name it by.
 *
 * An alias and its canonical are always siblings: a session is scoped to the
 * thread that called it, so a resume can only be issued from the array the
 * thread already sits in. Mirrors worker/run_records.go (resolveAliasTarget,
 * runByToolUseID, itemRunSettled).
