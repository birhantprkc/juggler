/**
 * Conversation naming — the browser-side SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the default
 * names an untitled conversation carries before it is titled, for the names
 * derived from another conversation ("<source> (copy)", "<source> (continued)"),
 * and for the doc-metadata key recording whether the current name is still
 * provisional. The placeholder shape is the twin of Go's
 * cmd/juggler/core/conversation_naming.go and worker.metaProvisionalName (the
 * marker key): the client generates the numbered placeholder a fresh
 * conversation requests, the worker seeds the marker from that same shape, and
 * the server's auto-namer reads the marker — so all of them must agree exactly.
 * Go tests read this file and assert they never drift — change both together.

 *  1. Strip an existing " (<word>)" / " (<word> N)" tail off sourceName, so
 *     re-deriving doesn't stack "X (copy) (copy)".
 *  2. Clip the BASE — never the suffix — to keep the whole name within
 *     maxLength. The suffix is the only thing distinguishing the derived tab
 *     from its source, so a source already near the cap gives up its own tail
 *     rather than have "(continued)" chopped to "(contin" by the server's
 *     filesystem-safety truncation (core.SanitizedNameMaxRunes), which cuts
 *     from the end and would otherwise leave the two tabs looking identical.
 *  3. Bump a counter — " (copy 2)", " (copy 3)", … — until isTaken reports the
 *     candidate free. Each candidate is clipped for its own suffix, so a longer
 *     counter tail eats further into the base instead of overflowing the cap.
 * @param {string} sourceName - Name of the conversation being derived from
 * @param {string} word - Suffix word, e.g. 'copy' or 'continued'
 * @param {(name: string) => boolean} isTaken - Reports whether a candidate name is already in use
 * @param {number} [maxLength] - Character cap for the result
 * @returns {string} A unique "<base> (<word>)" name within the cap.
