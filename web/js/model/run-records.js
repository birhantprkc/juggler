/**
 * Run records.
 *
 * A thread is a sequence of RUNS over one accumulating transcript: a run is one
 * message appended to the thread, the tool loop that message drives, and the
 * rest at the end of it. The message that starts a run carries that run's
 * record — `runStatus`/`runResult` once it settles — and that record, not the
 * thread's `result`, is what tells a parked caller the run is over. (`result`
 * is the thread's current summary; it outlives the run that wrote it.)
 *
 * The worker settles the runs it drives. This covers the one case it cannot: a
 * stop that reaches a thread the worker is not driving — a child spawned but
 * never dispatched — which would otherwise leave its caller waiting for a run
 * that is never going to happen.
 *
 * Pure Y.Map/Y.Array walking; callers wrap the write in their own transaction.
