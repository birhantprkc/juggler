/**
 * The pinboard as *this viewer* sees it: whether the board is open, which tab is
 * active, and what the last edit had to say for itself. None of that is shared —
 * {@link module:services/pinboard-store} holds the composition every viewer
 * agrees on, and a laptop and a detached display must not fight over which tab
 * either of them is reading.
 *
 * It is also the host service the rest of the UI calls to act on the board:
 * `toggle()`, `reveal()`, `addSource()`. A properties panel that wants to pin a
 * file describes the file and asks here; it never names a pin class, and it never
 * reaches into the board's components.
 *
 * The active pin is reconciled here rather than in the panel, because the board
 * changes for reasons this viewer had nothing to do with: another viewer removing
 * the pin you were reading must land you on its neighbour, not on the empty state.
 * @module services/pinboard-view
