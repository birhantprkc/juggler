/**
 * CycleBuffer — the shared display-defence lifecycle behind every hold-to-cycle
 * selector (strategy, model, thinking). It does NOT touch the doc; it only
 * governs when the doc is allowed to drive the collapsed button, so the two
 * things the selectors used to each hand-roll (and had drifted apart on) live in
 * one place:
 *
 *   1. **A frozen button during the gesture.** While the user holds the
 *      modifiers and cycles, the target is shown in the HUD (dropdown / popover)
 *      only — the collapsed button stays at the pre-gesture value. Nothing is
 *      written to the doc until release, so a running turn never sees an
 *      intermediate selection. While `buffering` is true the selector shows its
 *      committed snapshot on the button, and this buffer rejects every synced
 *      value so a mid-gesture rebuild can't move it.
 *
 *   2. **A short pin after commit.** On release the landing value X is written
 *      to the doc once and the button is repainted to X *directly*. But for a
 *      brief window afterwards the display can be shoved back to the PRE-gesture
 *      value by two things: a running turn's `yjs-sync` frames momentarily
 *      resolving `currentStrategyId`/`modelConfig` back before converging on X,
 *      and a rebuild that was constructed just before our write (so it still
 *      reads the old value) landing right after commit. Nothing ever writes the
 *      old value back — the doc always CONVERGES to X (see conversation-observers)
 *      — so this is purely a display concern: pin X and, for the pin's lifetime,
 *      accept ONLY a synced value equal to X (a harmless echo) while rejecting
 *      everything else as a stale bounce. The pin releases on a short timer, by
 *      which point the doc has settled on X, so a normal doc read then shows the
 *      right value with zero flicker. A genuine external change during the window
 *      is briefly masked and picked up when the pin releases (`onRelease`).
 *
 * The buffer is generic over the value type (a strategy-id string, a model
 * config object) via an `isEqual` comparator the caller supplies.
 * @module services/cycle-buffer
 */

/**
 * How long (ms) a post-commit pin defends the committed value against stale
 * post-commit rebuilds and the mid-turn sync bounce. It comfortably exceeds the
 * observed convergence window (~0.5-1s); once the doc has settled on the pinned
 * value, releasing is a no-op, and a genuine concurrent change is only masked
 * for this long before `onRelease` re-syncs.
