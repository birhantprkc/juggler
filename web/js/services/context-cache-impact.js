/**
 * One detection primitive for "will my next send re-read a large slice of the
 * cached conversation?" — surfaced as the composer's context-bust caution.
 *
 * The Anthropic prompt cache prefix is `[tools][system]` followed by the rolling
 * `[history]`; because it is prefix-matched, the next request hits the cache only
 * up to the first position that differs from what was last sent, and re-reads
 * everything after that divergence at full (uncached) price. So the cause of the
 * change is irrelevant — a staged strategy switch that alters the tool set, a
 * deleted or edited earlier message, anything that mutates the prefix — they are
 * all the same event: the outgoing prefix now diverges from the last-sent one
 * above the freshly-appended tail.
 *
 * We model the prefix as an ordered fingerprint. Element 0 is the MODEL: a cache
 * entry belongs to one model at one provider, so changing either discards the
 * whole prefix rather than diverging part-way down it — a different vendor has
 * nothing cached at all, and even a sibling model at the same vendor keys its
 * own entries. The thinking level is signed with it, because providers render
 * the thinking configuration into the prompt itself, so changing the level
 * starts a new prefix exactly as changing the model does. Putting all of that
 * first is what makes it fall out of the same diff: the divergence lands at
 * index 0 and the re-read slice is everything. Element 1
 * is the tool-set signature (the only part of `[tools][system]` a strategy
 * switch changes, since strategy guidance is injected as tail messages, never
 * placed in the system prompt), and the rest is one signature per history item. The baseline is the
 * fingerprint captured when the conversation last went idle (that transcript is
 * exactly what was cached). Diff current vs baseline: a divergence that *replaces*
 * a cached item (current is not a prefix of baseline) busts the cache from there;
 * the two ways current stays a prefix of baseline both cost nothing — a pure
 * append (a new user message) diverges only past the baseline's end, and a
 * truncation (`/clear`, deleting the tail) diverges only past the shortened
 * current's end, leaving the provider's cache still covering the whole outgoing
 * prefix. Undo restores the transcript, the fingerprint matches the baseline
 * again, and the caution clears.
 *
 * A divergence is necessary but not sufficient to caution: what actually costs is
 * the *size* of the uncached slice re-sent next turn — the previously-cached
 * content re-read from the divergence to the end of its overlap with the cached
 * prefix. Two independent things make that slice cheap, and either one alone
 * clears the caution:
 *   • the divergence sits near the end — editing the last message of a huge
 *     conversation busts the cache but re-reads only a short tail; or
 *   • the whole outgoing context is small — after a `/clear` (or any shrink to a
 *     handful of messages) even a 100%-changed prefix re-reads almost nothing, so
 *     who cares that the cache was lost.
 * Both reduce to the same number: the tokens in the re-read slice. We have one
 * real token measurement (the whole cached prefix, from the last turn's input
 * tokens) and the per-item content lengths baked into the fingerprint, so we
 * apportion that measurement by the content-length fraction that falls in the
 * re-read slice, and caution only when the estimate clears
 * CONTEXT_CACHE_WARNING_TOKENS. (A pure append adds new tail the cache never held,
 * beyond that overlap, so it is not counted — appending never busts.)
 *
 * Items that emit NOTHING to the provider are left out of the fingerprint
 * entirely (see NON_EMITTING_ITEM_TYPES). They are not in the cached prefix, so
 * they cannot move it: signing them would make deleting one — a `notice` a
 * reader tidied away, say — read as a divergence and raise a caution about a
 * bust that never happens.
