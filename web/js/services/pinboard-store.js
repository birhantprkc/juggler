/**
 * Client mirror of this document's pinboard composition — which pins are on the
 * board, in what order, configured how. The board is server-backed session
 * state, so this module owns exactly one thing: keeping the local copy true.
 *
 * One document reads exactly one board, named in its URL and fixed for its life:
 * the Juggler shell reads the shared one behind the docked panel, and a detached
 * window reads its own. So this stays a singleton, and the board it is a mirror
 * of is decided once, at load, by {@link module:utils/view-mode}. Every request
 * names it and every broadcast is checked against it, because the server tells
 * every viewer about every board — it has no way to know which one any of them
 * is showing.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT here: whether the board is open, which tab is active,
 * how wide the panel is, where each pin was scrolled to. That is per-viewer
 * presentation, and a laptop and a detached display must not fight over it.
 *
 * Edits are semantic operations, not whole-board writes, and the server merges
 * them on its session actor — so there is no revision, no conflict response, and
 * no rebase. Two viewers editing at the same instant both land. Each op names its
 * pin and is idempotent, so a retry after a dropped response cannot duplicate one.
 *
 * Every edit round-trips before the local board changes. The alternative —
 * applying optimistically and reconciling — would mean a second implementation of
 * the merge semantics living in the client, free to disagree with the server's.
 * The request is to a loopback server; correctness is worth more than the
 * milliseconds.
 *
 * Registers its websocket listeners at module-evaluation time, which precedes the
 * app's `connect()` — the same ordering `providers-cache.js` relies on.
