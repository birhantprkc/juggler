/**
 * The deliberate read of the project's working tree: the manifest a review is
 * worked from, and one file's patch at a time.
 *
 * Separate from {@link module:services/git-status-cache} on purpose, because the
 * two ask different questions. That one is ambient — a small, bounded,
 * best-effort answer polled for a number in the corner of a window — and this one
 * is what the user reads before telling the agent what to fix, where a file left
 * out is a change nobody reviews. Sharing state between them would make one of
 * the two wrong: either the card pays for a full review every twenty seconds, or
 * a review shows only what the card could cheaply reach.
 *
 * Nothing is retained. A manifest and a patch are live answers about a tree that
 * changes under them, and one kept here would be handed to the next surface as
 * though it were current; the surface showing one already holds what it drew, and
 * it knows when it last asked. So this module holds exactly two things: the
 * request currently out, so that two surfaces asking at once run git once, and
 * which project the questions are about, so that an answer arriving after that
 * changed is refused instead of shown.
 *
 * It never polls. A review happens because someone asked for one.
 * @module services/git-review-service
