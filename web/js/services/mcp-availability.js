/**
 * Why an MCP tool isn't reaching the model.
 *
 * MCP has two independent switches and only one of them is visible from the MCP
 * UI. A server can be configured, running, and reporting a full tool list while
 * the `@juggler/mcp` extension that publishes those tools is disabled — the
 * settings tab shows green dots, `/mcp` lists tools, and the model is offered
 * none of them. That gap is what this module closes: one place that knows the
 * extension can be off, so the settings tab, the System Prompt panel, and a
 * failed tool call can all say the same thing instead of each showing a
 * different half of the truth.
 * @module services/mcp-availability
