 * Opening the settings panel, as a module function rather than a global.

 * shell, the model layer — imports `openSettings` from here without importing
 * the panel. That is also why the call is a no-op until registration: it
 * preserves exactly the behaviour every caller used to hand-roll around the
 * `window.openSettings` global (`typeof … === 'function'` before calling it),
 * with the guard written once.
 *
 * `window.openSettings` survives as an alias for extensions.
