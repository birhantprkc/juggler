/**
 * Registries-ready gate — an awaitable signal that the three capability
 * registries (context-item, strategy, command) have completed their initial
 * hydration at least once.
 *
 * System-prompt assembly gates extension contributions on the set of enabled
 * plugin ids, which is only knowable once the registries have loaded. Awaiting
 * this signal before reading the registries guarantees the prompt is rendered
 * against a fully-hydrated set, so a turn that assembles the prompt during the
 * post-resume hydration window produces the same bytes as a steady-state turn.
 *
 * This module deliberately has NO imports: it sits below both the registries
 * layer (which marks it ready) and the services layer (which awaits it), so a
 * static import here would create a cycle.
 * @module registries/registry-ready

 * half-reset registry set and there is nothing to un-resolve.
