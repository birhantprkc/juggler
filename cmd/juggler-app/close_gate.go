// The close gate is everything a window close must settle while its page is
// still there to answer: confirming the discard of a turn the close would stop
// (busy_guard.go), and giving the page its chance to rescue composer drafts and
// report them safely on disk.
//
// Both need a live webview, and by the time a WindowClosing *listener* runs
// there is no longer one. Wails registers its own WindowClosing listener as the
// window is built, ahead of any of ours, and that listener marks the window
// destroyed and closes the webview immediately. Listeners for one event all run
// concurrently, so anything ours schedules onto the main thread arrives after
// that destroy — and ExecJS discards work aimed at a destroyed window silently,
// with no error to notice.
//
// Hooks are the seam that still has a page. They run synchronously, ahead of
// every listener, and one that cancels the event stops the listeners from
// running at all. So the gate cancels the close, settles on its own goroutine
// against a live page, and re-issues Close() — which finds the gate satisfied
// and falls through to the teardown in handleWindowClosed.

// closeReady reports whether a WindowClosing for e may proceed to teardown.
//
// A quit is exempt: confirmThenQuit tallies the whole app's in-flight work and
// notifies every window together before quitting, so gating each window again
// would only repeat what has already been asked and answered. So is a window no
// longer in the registry, which has nothing left to settle.

// claimSettle gives exactly one goroutine the right to run the gate for e,
// reporting whether this one won it. The window stays clickable while the gate
// runs, so a second close arriving meanwhile is cancelled by the hook and
// dropped here — rather than raising a second prompt, or announcing a second
// handshake that would orphan the first.
