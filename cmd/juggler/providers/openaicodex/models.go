//   - Copy MinClientVersion from the catalog's record for that slug. If it is
//     above codexClientVersion, raise that too — the tests will tell you.
//   - A slug the catalog has retired must be deleted from here. Left in place
//     it stays selectable long after the backend stops accepting it.
