// disallowedNativeTools is the explicit deny list passed to the CLI as
// --disallowedTools. Juggler serves every tool itself over the in-process MCP
// server (--allowedTools mcp__juggler__*), so any Claude-native tool left
// enabled is a hazard, in two distinct ways:
//
//   - A native name juggler does NOT serve produces a tool_use juggler never
//     answers. The dangling tool_use poisons synthetic resume (the CLI emits
//     end_turn with zero tokens on the next turn).
//   - A native name juggler DOES serve (Monitor is both a CLI built-in and a
//     juggler tool) is worse: canonicalToolName strips the absent
//     mcp__juggler__ prefix, so the parser cannot tell the two apart and
//     dispatches the block as juggler's own. The CLI meanwhile answers its
//     native call itself and never sends a tools/call, so juggler's result
//     finds no parked call and is stashed forever while the CLI blocks on its
//     next, genuinely-MCP call. Both sides wait: the conversation hangs until
//     teardown.
//
// The list is therefore deliberately over-broad — an entry the CLI doesn't
// know costs only a launch warning, which cli_lifecycle.go already filters,
// whereas a missing entry costs a wedged conversation. Re-check it against the
// CLI's built-in set whenever the pinned CLI version moves.
