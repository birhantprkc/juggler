// Process-wide throttle on concurrently-streaming claude CLI turns.
//
// One Client (and one persistent CLI) exists per conversation, so without a
// shared cap a fan-out of N subthreads spawns N CLIs whose first turns all hit
// the account's API at once. That synchronized burst is the most likely
// trigger for the "exited unexpectedly" failure: the concurrent streams
// momentarily exceed the account's concurrency / usage limits and the CLIs are
// killed. cliTurnSlots bounds how many turns may ACTIVELY STREAM at the same
// time; the rest queue (with backpressure, never failure).
//
// Deadlock-freedom — the key property the cap must not break:
//
//   - A slot is held ONLY while a turn is actively streaming (the body of
//     streamMessage). The instant a turn pauses for tool approval it returns
//     from streamMessage and releases its slot. A turn that spawned subthreads
//     and is "waiting" for them has therefore already released — it is parked
//     at a tool_use boundary, holding NO slot. So a parent can never hold a
//     slot a child needs: the parent→child wait does not pass through the
//     semaphore.
//   - A slot holder only ever blocks on its own CLI's stdout (or ctx), never
//     on another conversation making progress. So no slot holder waits on a
//     slot seeker, the wait graph has no cycle, and the cap cannot deadlock.
//   - acquire is ctx-aware: a turn cancelled while queued for a slot bails
//     immediately rather than hanging, so even a misconfigured cap of 1 can't
//     wedge a cancellable turn.
