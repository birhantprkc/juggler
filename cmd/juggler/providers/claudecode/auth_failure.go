// subcommand deliberately — `auth login` has been observed reporting success
// while persisting nothing, whereas the in-session `/login` is what the CLI's

// same underlying condition several ways: a rejected API call carries
// api_error_status 401, but a CLI that knows up front it has no usable
// credential answers with bare text and no status at all.
//
// Matched case-insensitively as substrings, and deliberately specific: each of
// these is a whole phrase the CLI emits, not a word like "auth" that ordinary
// failures also contain.
