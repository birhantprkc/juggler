//     tools/call waiting for our tool results. Feed the results via MCP and
//     resume reading. (No new CLI invocation; this is mid-LLM-turn.)
//
//  2. Resume with delta: no live CLI, but we have a stored sessionUUID and the
//     new req.Messages is a strict linear extension of what claude already has.
//     Spawn `claude --resume <uuid> --input-format stream-json` and pipe only
//     the delta on stdin. Prompt cache stays warm.
//
//  3. Fresh start: divergent history or first turn. Spawn with `-p
//     --input-format stream-json` and capture the session id from the
//     system/init event so future turns can use --resume.
//
// Per-conversation state lives on c.activeSession; one *Client is bound
// to one conversation via the server's conversationCache, so no global
// lookup is needed. Cold-start after a juggler restart loads state from
// the on-disk sidecar.
// req.ToolChoice is intentionally NOT honoured here: the claude CLI exposes no
// tool_choice / forced-function-call equivalent (only --allowedTools /
// --disallowedTools name-gating, which cannot compel a call). A plugin that
// forces a tool therefore degrades gracefully under claudecode — the model may
// answer in text, and the run settles on that trailing text as the thread's
// summary. If the CLI ever gains a forced-tool option, translate
// req.ToolChoice here.
// req.MaxOutputTokens (F1's per-request wire output cap) is likewise ignored:
// the CLI transport has no per-request max_tokens knob. Admission still charges
// the smaller reserve, which is safe here — the CLI cannot overshoot its own

// coldStartFallback is the single funnel for every cold start: both the ones
// classifyRegime chooses up front and the ones a warm path falls back to when
// something fails mid-dispatch. Either way the entire conversation is
// re-ingested, so either way it must announce itself — one greppable
// "⚠ claudecode cache-miss" line, plus the UI status warning when the loss is
// consequential enough to be worth interrupting for.
//
// Mid-dispatch fallbacks used to log at debug level and nothing more, which
// made a full re-ingest effectively undetectable: the NEXT turn's cache hit
// ratio reads ~99% (a small truncated context re-reads perfectly), so the only
// symptom is absolute input tokens collapsing and the token spend climbing.
// Every cold start goes through here so that can't recur silently.
//
// Order is load-bearing: emitCacheMissWarning reads the session's sentCount to
// distinguish a real loss from a first turn, and dispatchFreshStart releases
// the session — so the warning must be emitted first.

// fails (common after sleep/wake), the old sidecar is still the retry's only
// warm-resume anchor; deleting it here causes repeated "no prior session" cold
