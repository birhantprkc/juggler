// TestCatalogInvariants checks every catalogued model of every provider against

// network. These are the failures no amount of live discovery can rescue,
// because they are wrong before a request is ever built:
//
//   - A window of zero or less is not a limit. Admission fails closed on an
//     unknown window, which is the right answer for a model nobody catalogued —
//     but an entry that exists and says nothing is just a broken entry.
//   - An output cap at or above the window leaves no room for input at all. The
//     provider answers such a request with a 400, so the model is unusable for
//     as long as the entry stands. (The server's normalizeOutputLimit catches
//     this at runtime and substitutes a derived reserve, which is a safety net,
//     not a licence to ship the number.)
//   - A resolver and a map that disagree about the same model would make the
//     window depend on which of the two a caller happened to ask.

// happens: resolution simply finds no match and reports no cheap model, so the

// feature nobody is watching. This test is what turns it into a build failure
// at the moment the catalog is edited.

// ("ministral-8b-2512"). Providers with no static catalog are skipped — their
