// window, no output cap, not even a created timestamp. There is nothing for
// endpoint discovery to read, so this file is not a fallback here: it is the
// only source of limits DeepSeek models will ever have, and an entry that goes
// stale stays stale until someone edits it.

// ModelContextWindows maps DeepSeek model names to context window sizes (tokens).
// Every current API model carries a 1M-token window (DeepSeek API docs, Models
// & Pricing).
//
// 1000000 rather than the 1048576 the weights config allows: DeepSeek publishes
// the round figure, and this number decides when a conversation compacts and
// when admission refuses a request. Being 4.6% under the true ceiling costs a
// little context; being over it fails a turn with the whole prompt already
// built. The direction of the error is chosen, not accidental.

// The entry that used to live here was for deepseek-reasoner (R1), and the
// reason it existed outlives it: a reasoning model spends output budget on
// chain-of-thought before the answer, so a cap sized for a chat model throttles
// the reasoning itself and yields empty `finish=length` turns. Every model
// DeepSeek now serves reasons, and every one of them documents 384K — which
// fits alongside the 600K of input the 60% budget allows in a 1M window.
