// engineConnectTimeout bounds how long the engine-readiness gate waits for the
// hidden engine WebView to load /engine and connect its WebSocket. Generous: a
// cold engine connects in ~1–2s at startup; this is the ceiling a turn waits
// before failing with engine-not-available (only ever relevant during the
// startup window or a watchdog re-exec, since the engine otherwise stays up).
const engineConnectTimeout = 30 * time.Second

// newEngineWindow builds (but does not run) the hidden engine WebviewWindow. The
// engine page boots the worker-backed runtime (web/js/engine-worker-main.js):
// the engine's WebSocket and tool execution run in a module worker, off the
// WebView's main thread, so WebKit's hidden/accessory main-thread throttling
// can't stall them.
//
// KeepRunningWhenHidden is Disabled (WKInactiveSchedulingPolicyThrottle): the
// hidden page main thread is allowed to throttle, so WebKit never pins an
// always-on CVDisplayLink — the display link is the exact path WebKit deadlocks
// on across a display reconfiguration (monitor hot-plug, display sleep, scaling
// switch). The engine's real work lives in the module worker, which keeps
// processing at full rate regardless of the main thread's throttle state, so
// the engine can safely stay alive for the whole process lifetime.
//
// Windows takes the opposite setting for the opposite reason. WebView2 has no
// display-link hazard; what it has is efficiency mode, which a window created
// hidden falls into as soon as Wails hides its controller — and it throttles
// the whole page's timers toward 0Hz, module workers included, so the engine
// stops executing tools. KeepRunningWhenHidden keeps the controller visible to
// WebView2 (the window itself is never shown), at the cost of an invisible
// input surface where the window sits.
//
// WebviewGpuPolicyNever forces software rendering for this WebView on Linux
// (WebKitGTK). The engine page is off-screen and paints nothing — its work runs
// in a module worker — so it has no use for GPU acceleration. Left at the
// zero-value default (WebviewGpuPolicyAlways), WebKitGTK insists on the
// hardware path and, on a broken or absent GL stack (VM software GL, no DRI,
// headless), fails to bring the WebView up at all — the engine WebSocket never
// connects, engineConnectTimeout elapses, and tool execution never starts.
// Scoped to this window only: the visible viewer window is a separate window in
// the juggler-app process and keeps its own (accelerated) GPU policy.
