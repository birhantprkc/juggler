// Native thread sampling for a wedged main thread.
//
// The main-thread watchdog can tell that the main queue stopped draining, but
// not why: the Go side is parked in cgo and a Go traceback shows only that. The
// frames that would name the culprit are Objective-C and C++ ones inside
// AppKit, WebKit and CoreVideo, and the only way to read them is to sample the
// process from outside. macOS ships exactly that tool — /usr/bin/sample, which
// needs no privileges to examine a process owned by the same user, and labels
// the thread we care about "DispatchQueue_1: com.apple.main-thread".
//
// Sampling is fired from the stall WARNING, not the wedge: by the time the
// watchdog gives up the process has seconds to live, and the sample must be on
// disk before the image is replaced.
