// wait on its process handle, which becomes signalled when the parent exits —
// clean quit, crash, or kill alike. This is what makes --exit-with-parent
// actually tear the server down with the desktop app on Windows (the Job Object's
// kill-on-close doesn't reliably propagate through Win10/11's nested jobs).
