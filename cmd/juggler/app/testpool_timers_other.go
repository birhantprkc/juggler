// (Windows.KeepRunningWhenHidden), so its timers are not backgrounded in the
// first place, and GTK3 is a Wails build tag this project neither ships nor
// tests. In a production build it is excluded deliberately — see the macOS file
// for why the SPI must not reach a shipped binary.

// because on these platforms it always has: a hidden Cocoa or WebView2 window
// is still an allocated one, so its web view is the size the window was asked
// for and the lanes in it lay out in a page of that size. GTK4 is the port that
// leaves an unmapped window's web view at 0x0 — see the Linux file.
