// launchedFromTerminal reports whether juggler was started from an existing
// terminal (cmd.exe / PowerShell / Windows Terminal) rather than the Explorer /
// Start-menu icon.
//
// juggler is a console-subsystem binary because that is the only Windows
// subsystem a shell actually *waits* on: a terminal launch then runs in the
// foreground with visible output, Ctrl+C, and the interactive keys. (A
// GUI-subsystem binary would instead detach into a hidden background process
// the moment it's run from a shell.) The cost is that an icon launch makes
// Windows allocate a fresh console window for us — but that is the right thing
// here: this binary is the *server*, so a double-click should show its terminal,
// not impersonate the desktop app. We deliberately keep that console (the GUI
// lives in juggler-app.exe; users launch that for a window).
//
// We tell a shell launch from an icon launch with GetConsoleProcessList: a shell
// launch shares the shell's console, so ≥2 processes are attached, whereas an
// icon launch owns a brand-new console alone (exactly 1). term.IsTerminal can't
// distinguish them — both look like a genuine console — so this process-count
// test is the reliable signal. The result only drives the project default
// (cwd for a shell launch, none/"choose a session" for an icon launch); see
// resolveStartupProject.
