// ConvOwnership is the test-mode conversation ownership ledger. In the
// multi-lane browser-test pool every lane shares ONE server session, so the
// safety boundary for destructive operations is "which lane created this
// conversation". Each create tagged with a lane records ownership here; the
// delete/bin handlers consult CheckDelete before tearing the worker down, so
// a cross-lane delete — which would freeze the victim lane's in-flight test —
// is rejected at the API boundary instead of depending on every JS call site
// behaving. Conversations created without a lane tag (bootstrap convs,
// worker-side duplicates, production paths) are unowned and unprotected.
//
// At suite end Dump() lists every still-owned conversation: each one is a
// test that leaked a conversation it created, named by its lane's last
// recorded reason. The Go harness fails the run on a non-empty dump so leaks
// stay loud instead of silently marching the shared session toward the
// MAX_CONVERSATIONS cap.

// per the project concurrency rule).
