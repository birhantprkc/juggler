// reattachHarness wires a worker with an attached engine that counts the
// execute-tool commands the worker dispatches, keyed by toolUseId. A
// sentinel rides the SAME ordered engine mailbox as the commands, so flush()
// is a deterministic barrier (no sleeps): once the callback observes the
// sentinel, every command enqueued before it has already been delivered.
//
// The engine callback runs on its own mailbox goroutine, so each execute-tool
// id is handed to the test goroutine over a buffered channel (no mutex); the
// tally map is drained and read only on the test goroutine, after flush().
