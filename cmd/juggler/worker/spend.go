// What a conversation has spent, and the ceiling that stops it running away.
//
// Every round-trip's usage was logged and then forgotten: the per-turn figures
// went to the conversation log, the per-thread ones onto the thread tile as
// estimates, and nothing anywhere added them up. A conversation could therefore
// spend tens of millions of input tokens — most of it inside sub-threads nobody
// was watching — with no figure on screen saying so, and the total obtainable
// only by summing log lines afterwards.
//
// The counter is conversation-wide because that is the unit a person spends in.
// It runs on ConversationWorker, which is one per conversation (manager.go) and
// is shared by every thread's run through the embedded pointer in `run`, so a
// figure recorded on a sub-thread's goroutine lands in the same total as the
// root's. That is the whole reason it lives here rather than on turnState.
//
// Both figures are what the PROVIDER billed, never the local admission estimate:
// the estimator is deliberately conservative (see approximateTokenCount) and
// runs up to ~2x hot on structured content, which is tolerable for deciding when
// to compact and not tolerable in a number a ceiling acts on.
//
// What is counted is NEW input — the prompt minus the part served from cache.
// An agentic turn re-sends its whole prompt at every tool round-trip, and a warm
// prompt is ~99% cache read, so counting whole prompts measures how long someone
// worked rather than what they spent: forty sessions of ordinary work, measured
// against the providers' own transcripts, came to 95.5M of prompt and 3.9M of
// new input. A runaway fan-out still climbs fast under this rule, because a
// fresh transcript is cache WRITE, not cache read.
const (
	// metaSpendNewInput is the conversation's cumulative NEW input tokens, every
	// thread included. Durable top-level metadata rather than part of the
	// ephemeral processingState blob, because it is a lifetime figure: it must
	// survive the reload that follows the crash people want it for.
	//
	// A key of its own rather than the older spendInputTokens, whose stored
	// values counted whole prompts: those totals are 20-30x this scale, and
	// seeding from one (addSpendFloored takes the document as a floor) would put
	// an existing conversation past any sane ceiling on its first turn.

// guessed. Across 1,024 provider sessions of real work, new input per session
// ran to a median of 0.28M, a p95 of 0.88M and a maximum of 5.93M; a
// conversation is several sessions, so ten million leaves an ordinary one —
// however long — well clear, while a fan-out cold-starting transcript after
// transcript reaches it quickly. A ceiling that fires in normal use would be
// read as noise and switched off, which is the one outcome that helps nobody.

// per turn by the model's own reserve; input is what a runaway's cost is made
// of.
