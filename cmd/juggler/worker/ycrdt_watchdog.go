// Stall detector for the process-wide y-crdt lock.
//
// ycrdtMu is the single global lock in the server and every conversation
// worker's doc access goes through it, so one goroutine that stops releasing
// it takes down the whole app: every conversation freezes mid-turn and nothing
// persists, while the layers that never touch a doc (HTTP, session manager,
// auto-naming) keep answering — which makes the server look alive and hides
// the cause. The lock is not reentrant, so the cheapest way to reach that
// state is a path that takes it and then calls a helper that takes it again
// instead of the helper's ...Locked variant.
//
// That failure leaves no trace of its own: the process simply goes quiet.
// This watchdog exists to turn it into evidence. It samples how long the
// current acquisition has been held and, past ycrdtStallThreshold, logs one
// full goroutine dump. The blocked stacks name the offending path directly,
// and every other worker is visible parked on the same lock.
//
// Diagnosis only: it never releases the lock or intervenes. A false positive
// costs one noisy log entry, so the threshold is set well above any legitimate
// hold (doc mutations are microseconds; the longest are bulk compaction
// splices).
