// A turn opens by asking the engine for its context and its tool list, and
// waits ContextTimeout for both. Three stages can spend that budget and they
// call for three different fixes: the request queueing behind other traffic on
// the way out, the engine's own work (its fetches share a six-connection
// browser pool with every tool call), and the reply's trip back. The worker
// times the whole thing and can separate them only because the engine stamps
// the reply — see beginRoundTrip in worker-manager-protocols.js. Both realms
// run on one machine and one wall clock, so the marks subtract directly.
//
// This matters most for the round-trip that never finishes in time: the reply
// usually does arrive, just too late to be wanted, and it carries the only
// account of where the 30s went.

// slowRoundTripMS is the elapsed time at which a completed round-trip is worth
// a line in the log. Well clear of a healthy turn's few milliseconds, and well
// under ContextTimeout, so the log shows the approach as well as the arrival.
