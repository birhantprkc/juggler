// than a plain struct because a turn no longer runs on the worker's run() loop:
// the turn writes the document and flushes at its own boundaries while the run()
// loop is still pumping messages and flushing at its, and two goroutines sharing
// a *time.Timer and a slice is a data race. Serializing through one goroutine
// keeps the batch coherent without a mutex, which the package forbids.
//
// The timer fires inside the actor, so callers no longer select on it — this is
// why there is no TimerChan: a wait loop that wanted the batch flushed on time
// had to service that timer itself, and none of them own it any more.
