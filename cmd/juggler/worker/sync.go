// output will be, so it grows an internal buffer as it goes; the length of a
// base64 encoding, by contrast, is known exactly before a byte is written. On
// a streaming delta the difference is nothing. On a full-state sync it is the
// whole cost: marshalling a 96 MiB update allocates ~224 MB to produce a
// 134 MB result, where sizing it exactly allocates the 134 MB and no more —
// 89 MB less garbage per send, on the path where the result is already the
// largest thing the process is holding. (BenchmarkMarshalYjsSync covers the
// sizes an ordinary session sees, where the two are within a few percent; the
// gap opens well above them.)
//
// The output is byte-identical to json.Marshal of the equivalent
// YjsSyncMessage, which sync_format_test.go pins against the real encoder
// rather than against a hand-written expectation. Base64's alphabet needs no
// JSON escaping and contains none of the characters encoding/json escapes for
// HTML, so "identical" needs no qualification.

// FormatWorkerMessage creates a worker message for sending to browser.
//
// This is the server's hottest function: every worker message bound for a
// viewer passes through it, once per recipient. It used to build the envelope
// with encoding/json, which walked the entire payload TWICE just to add a
// ~90-byte wrapper:
//
//   - json.Unmarshal(workerMsg, &generic) to read one field, "type" — but
//     Unmarshal runs checkValid over the whole document first.
//   - json.Marshal(msg) with Payload as a json.RawMessage — the encoder runs
//     appendCompact over the whole payload again, copying it into a growing
//     bytes.Buffer.
//
// Profiling a viewer sync on a large conversation (a ~55MB Yjs doc) put this
// one function at 64% of all server CPU — appendCompact 39%, checkValid 23% —
// and a heap profile attributed 290MB of live heap to its envelope buffers,
// against only ~76MB of actual CRDT data.
//
// Neither pass buys anything. The payload is ALWAYS the output of a successful
// json.Marshal in this same process: its only producers are
// ConversationWorker.send and ConversationWorker.reply, which both marshal and
// return early if that fails (see worker.go), so nothing else can reach here.
// The bytes are therefore already valid and already compact, and re-validating
// then re-compacting them is pure overhead.
//
// So the envelope is assembled by appending into one exactly-sized buffer with
// the payload copied verbatim — a single memmove, no scan, no reallocation.

	// put malformed JSON on the wire: a truncated payload, whose "type" is
