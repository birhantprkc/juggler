// The rate-limit latch: what one thread learns about an account-level usage cap,
// the rest of the conversation is spared having to find out.
//
// A usage cap is a fact about the account, not about the request — so it stands
// over every thread on that provider at once. Without the latch each live thread
// discovers it separately: a root turn and five delegated children each spend
// their retries against a limit none of them can clear, which is eighteen
// requests charged to the window the user is waiting for, and twelve error items
// saying the same sentence.
//
// Three rules keep it honest:
//
//   - Only a STATED reset latches. A wait nobody supplied is a guess
//     (defaultRetryWait), and a guess must not stop a conversation.
//   - It expires by itself, on read. There is no timer and nothing to re-tickle
//     the reducer when the cap lifts: threads held here have settled at rest, and
//     the user's next message is what starts the conversation again.
//   - A user send lifts it. Typing into a capped conversation is an explicit
//     "try anyway", and it costs exactly one request to find out.
//
// Keyed by provider name, which is the granularity credentials are resolved at
// (server/llm_caller.go) and therefore the granularity a quota belongs to.
// Deliberately per-conversation and in memory only: it is an optimisation over
// finding out, never a source of truth about the account.

// latchRateLimit records that providerName is capped until the stated time, and
// reports whether this call was the one that discovered it. Only the discoverer
// reports the cap to the user; the threads behind it rest, so a conversation-wide
// refusal reads as one message rather than one per thread.
//
// A later, longer reset extends a standing hold — the provider has moved the
// wall, and the conversation follows it — but does not make that caller a
// discoverer.
