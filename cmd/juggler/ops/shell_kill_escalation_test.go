// A force-kill names a whole process TREE by one pid, and that pid means what
// the killer thinks only until the process is reaped: cmd.Wait releases the
// handle reserving the number, and the OS is then free to hand the same number
// to something else — Windows recycles pids within seconds. Each of the three
// escalations here runs on a timer, seconds after the polite stop, so each must
// establish that its target is still un-reaped before taking its group.
//
// These tests count escalations rather than their effect: an escalation aimed at
// a reaped pid is indistinguishable from a correct one once it has landed, and
// its victim is whatever inherited the number.
//
// What is asserted throughout is the ORDER of the two events, never how far
// apart the machine put them. An escalation is only wrong once the reap has
// happened, so every "must not escalate" test below waits for the reap and says
// so; one that arrives after its escalation was due leaves nothing to assert,
// because taking the group there is exactly right. The suite runs
// race-instrumented alongside three other packages spawning processes of their
// own, where a reap that lost a race by milliseconds says nothing about the
// code.

// deliberately does not perform them — provoking the defect for real would kill
// whatever process on this machine now holds the recycled pid. Returns the count
