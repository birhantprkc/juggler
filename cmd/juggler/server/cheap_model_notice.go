// noCheapModelNotice is what the user is told when a micro-task finds no cheap
// model. Information first: what stopped, and where to fix it. The tasks it
// names are the ones they might have noticed not happening.
const noCheapModelNotice = "No cheap model is set, so background tasks like naming tabs can't run. Pick one in Settings → Defaults."

// cheapModelForTask resolves the cheap model for a micro-task that is about to
// run, and tells the user once per server run when there isn't one.
//
// It exists to separate two questions that resolveCheapModel cannot tell apart:
// something wanted to run and couldn't, versus something merely asked what the
// setting currently resolves to. Only the first is worth interrupting anyone
// over, so the settings endpoint calls resolveCheapModel directly and this is
// what the auto-namer and /api/llm/complete call.
//
// Once per run, and not per task, because the cause is configuration: it holds
// for every micro-task equally, so announcing each one would put a toast on
// screen for every new conversation. That cost is why this was previously not
// announced at all — and being announced nowhere is why a user whose provider
// has no cheap tier had no way to find out that tab naming had quietly stopped.
// The counter resets when the server does, which is the right cadence for a
// message about something the user has to go and change.
//
// Nothing is said when the user has turned the cheap model off. They know.
