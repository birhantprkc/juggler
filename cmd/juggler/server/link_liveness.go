// Link liveness: proof that a client's connection still carries traffic in both
// directions. This is a different question from engine liveness
// (engine_liveness.go), which asks whether the engine's JS realm is running —
// here the link itself is what is in doubt.
//
// Nothing below the application layer answers it in useful time. A half-open TCP
// connection — a laptop suspended mid-turn, a phone leaving wifi, a NAT
// rebinding — stays open at both ends with no RST, and the kernel only gives up
// after the keepalive ladder on the viewer listener (listenForViewers,
// shutdown.go) has run, which is about two minutes. WebSocket ping/pong would be
// quicker and proves the wrong thing, for the same reason it does for the
// engine: in WebKit the socket lives in the network process, so control frames
// are still answered by a machine whose page has stopped.
//
// So both ends speak for themselves, at the application layer:
//
//   - the server sends {"type":"heartbeat"} whenever it has had nothing to say
//     for serverBeatInterval, so an idle viewer has something to measure its
//     link by rather than sitting in silence it cannot interpret;
//   - a viewer sends {"type":"viewer-heartbeat"} on the same terms (VIEWER_BEAT_MS
//     in web/js/services/websocket.js), and one that has said nothing at all for
//     viewerSilenceWindow has its socket closed so it reconnects.
//
// Traffic proves the same thing a beat does, so any inbound message refreshes
// the stamp and neither side beats on a link that is already busy: a streaming
// turn costs nothing extra.
const (
	// serverBeatInterval is how long a link may stay quiet before the server
	// speaks. The viewer's stall watchdog is what consumes it — it drops a link
	// that has produced nothing for three of these windows — so this is the unit
	// that decides how fast a dead link is noticed.

	// is closed. Five missed viewer beats, and deliberately generous: holding a
	// wedged viewer costs only its socket and whatever is queued for it, the
	// viewer's own watchdog drops a stalled link and reconnects well before this,
	// and a window tight enough to catch a viewer whose timers are merely starved
	// would also cut sessions that were fine.
