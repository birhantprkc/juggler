	// wsWriteTimeout bounds how long a single message write may block.
	//
	// A peer can accept a connection and then stop draining it — a suspended
	// laptop, dead wifi, a half-open TCP connection nothing has noticed. The
	// write then sits in the kernel socket buffer indefinitely, and the stall
	// propagates: the writer goroutine blocks, its 256-deep send buffer fills,
	// trySend blocks behind it, and any actor that calls Send inline blocks
	// behind that. One dead client stalls every live one, so the write needs a
	// bound even though there is nothing to usefully do when it expires.
	//
	// 60s sits well clear of the slowest legitimate write. The worst of those
	// is a remote viewer pulling a full-state resync, which runs to megabytes
	// on a large conversation — but remote peers negotiate permessage-deflate,
	// so the wire size is a fraction of the logical one, and the deadline
	// covers handing the message to the kernel, not its round trip. That
	// clears a multi-megabyte transfer on a link an order of magnitude worse
	// than a usable one. Shorter is tempting (it is also the bound on how long
	// a wedged client can stall an actor) but below ~30s a slow-but-alive
	// client on a big conversation is at risk, and killing it mid-resync
	// buys nothing: it reconnects and repeats the same transfer.
	wsWriteTimeout = 60 * time.Second

	// wsCloseWriteTimeout bounds the goodbye frame. Two bytes on a connection
	// that is going away regardless, so it gets a short budget — the only
	// thing waiting behind it is teardown.

	// wsWriteBufferSize sizes the per-connection buffer gorilla frames
	// outgoing messages in.
	//
	// gorilla splits a compressed message across frames as soon as it outgrows
	// this buffer, and fragmented compressed frames are the shape WebKit has
	// historically mishandled — which matters here because every Juggler
	// viewer is WebKit (WKWebView on macOS, WebKitGTK on Linux) and remote
	// peers are exactly the ones that negotiate permessage-deflate. The
	// library's own guidance is to make the buffer larger than any expected
	// message. Juggler cannot honour that literally, since a full-state resync
	// runs to megabytes, but 32 KiB keeps ordinary traffic — sync deltas,
	// status, tool output chunks — inside a single frame, and costs one
	// syscall per 32 KiB rather than per kilobyte. Do not shrink it.
	wsWriteBufferSize = 32 * 1024

	// wsReadBufferSize sizes the per-connection buffer gorilla reads incoming
	// frames through.
	//
	// It does not bound message size — gorilla streams a frame's payload
	// through this buffer, refilling it with one read syscall at a time — so it
	// is purely the granularity of inbound I/O. Juggler's inbound traffic is
	// dominated by yjs-sync updates, which run to megabytes when a viewer
	// pushes a large edit or completes a resync, and at a kilobyte apiece that
	// is thousands of syscalls per update where 32 KiB is tens. Matched to the
	// write buffer for that reason rather than any symmetry requirement.
	//
	// gorilla allocates both buffers per connection, so the resting cost is
	// (read + write) × connections. Juggler holds a handful — one engine and a
	// few viewers — which is what makes generous buffers the right trade here;
	// a server fielding thousands of mostly idle connections would want the
	// opposite. Deliberately no SetReadLimit to accompany it: no safe bound
	// exists when one yjs-sync update can be tens of megabytes, and every
	// upgrade is authenticated before it reaches this buffer.

// quiet connections. Juggler is the opposite shape — a handful of connections
// (one engine, a few viewers) writing constantly for the length of a turn — so
