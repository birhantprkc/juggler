// Package windowgeom holds the window geometry persistence shared by the two
// Wails hosts: the server's test-pool window (cmd/juggler/app) and the desktop
// app's window registry (cmd/juggler-app). Both read the same frame out of the
// same session store — one in-process, one over the window-state HTTP route —
// so the questions "what frame is this window in", "when do I write it" and
// "where do I put a window given a saved frame" have one answer each.
//
// What deliberately stays with the caller: the sink (which store the frame goes
// to), the error policy, and marshalling onto the main thread. Capture reads
// live native state and so must run on the main thread, but the two hosts hop
// there at different layers, and the server's close path skips the hop on
// purpose — so the hop is documented here and performed by the caller.
